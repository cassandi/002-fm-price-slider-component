# Frontend Mentor - Interactive pricing component solution

Second project in my series on simply frontend challengs. I find this is a good way to expose myself to new requirements and explore aspects of semantic HTML, new CSS selectors and properties, and browser support that I have not yet come across professionally. 

See the challenge details here: [Interactive pricing component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers
